# Configuration for Condor job submission
#
# The following variables should be defined here:
#
# QPATH ..... absolute pathname for the directory where the Condor
#             commands ('condor_submit', etc.) are installed.
# QPROFILE .. absolute pathname for a setup script, which will be
#               executed before running any queue commands.
# QSUB ...... the name of the job submission command (typically 'condor_submit')
# QDEL ...... the name of the job cancellation command (typically 'condor_rm')
# QSTAT ..... the name of the job status command (typically 'condor_q')
#
# LICENSE_CHECKING ... support license checking?
#                      (any non-blank value turns on license-checking)
#
# Notes: 
# 1) Either QPATH or QPROFILE should be specified (but not both).
# 2) QSUB, QDEL, and QSTAT normally don't need to be changed here.
#
# For assistance, please contact help@schrodinger.com
